# CircuitTrainingTimer

Practice project to demonstate my abilities as an android developer. 

What this project does is it allows users to create a timer, name it what ever they would like to name it and add a consecuative timer to the initial one that they created.
Once the initial timer hits zero the next timer will start. The inspiration for this project arross while I conducted my circuit training exercises. The timer on my phone was ok but it didn't start a rest timer once the exercise timer was up, I had to that manually. It also didn't allow me to add extra timers for different exercises to start one after the other kinda like an obstcle course. Rather than browsing the play store for such an application I thought it would be good practice to make my own.
